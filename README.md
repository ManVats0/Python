Prject Smc file will take an excel file as an input from meltwater and will remove the columns i dont need and the raws that are irrelevant for me for making a social media report of top tweets tagging @narendramodi official id on twitter. This also helps in removing the tweets which i dont need since they have written some negative words in the bio, content. So this will remove those entries, furthermore, this will sort every entry according to the followers count and verified - true which is mentioned in my file
In my prospective meltwater used to give me the data for not required tweets so i automated this task...
